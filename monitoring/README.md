This directory contains the configuration files needed to set up monitoring for the Apple Quality Prediction ML model using Prometheus and Grafana.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- The ML model application running

### Starting the Monitoring Stack

1. Navigate to the monitoring directory:

   ```
   cd monitoring
   ```

2. Start the monitoring stack using Docker Compose:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the monitoring tools:
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3000

### Grafana Setup

1. Log in to Grafana with the default credentials:

   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin
   - You'll be prompted to change the password on first login

2. The Prometheus data source and ML Model dashboard should be automatically provisioned.

3. Navigate to Dashboards â†’ ML Model Monitoring to view the pre-configured dashboard.

## Dashboard Features

The ML Model Monitoring dashboard includes:

- Total HTTP requests
- Average request duration
- Memory usage
- Total prediction requests
- Prediction quality metrics

## Customizing Dashboards

You can create additional dashboards or modify the existing one:

1. In Grafana, click the "+" icon in the sidebar
2. Select "Create Dashboard"
3. Add panels using metrics from Prometheus
4. Save your dashboard

## Troubleshooting

- If metrics aren't showing up, check that Prometheus can reach your application
- Verify the scrape configuration in `prometheus.yml`
- Check the Prometheus targets page at http://localhost:9090/targets

## Taking Screenshots

To capture a screenshot of your Grafana dashboard for submission:

1. Navigate to your dashboard
2. Adjust the time range to show meaningful data
3. Use your browser's screenshot functionality or press Print Screen
